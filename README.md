The simples unfinished programming languaje you can find out there

</br>

## About
This is the development of a 🔮 Kaleidoscope like languaje. It is the result of following the llvm [tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/) on how to create a frontend programming languaje. This project is based on the [**🐉 LLVM**](https://llvm.org) library commonly used for building compilers. Up to now the _parser_, _lexer_, _AST_, the _code generation functions_ and the _JIT drivers_ have been implemented.

Why **discontinued**? It is an really big work to maintain and continue adding new features to this project having limited time.

Feel free to PR this repo an add more stuff 🚀🚀 (only lit things accepted 😉)

## Usage
⚙️ There is a _make file_. </br> 📦 All you have to do is [install](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html) the llvm tools and build the project with CMake.

## Motivation
If you have ever seen any [@codediodeio](https://github.com/codediodeio) video you know how 🔥 epic 🔥 is to make stuff. After seen the [LLVM video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT2Cv-Tjq7Q) I decided I wanted to try myself and develop something similar. It is really challenging to work with the library that powers some modern compilers like clang, Rust compiler or Swift compiler. In order to make this jurney easier, I have followed the official tutorial on [llvm.org](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/)
